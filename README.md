# FlickrImageGallery

FSJS Techdegree Project 7

This project is a React app that allows a user to use the Flickr API to view photos searched using a tag. Three default tags are presented in the navigation heading.

## Prerequisites before use

This project requires the use of a Flickr API key. Here is how to use one for this project:

1. Use a Yahoo! or Tumblr account to sign into Flickr.
2. Apply for an [API Key.](https://www.flickr.com/services/apps/create/apply/)
3. Create a `.env` file in the root directory with the following structure:

    ```env
    FLICKR_KEY=YOUR API KEY
    ```

    Replacing `YOUR API KEY` with the API key that you recieved from Flickr.

After doing this, proceed to install dependencies and run the application as normal.
